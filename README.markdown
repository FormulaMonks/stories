Stories and User Acceptance Tests for the minimalist test framework [Contest](http://github.com/citrusbyte/contest).

Description
-----------

Write user stories and user acceptace tests using Contest, the tiny add on to Test::Unit that provides nested contexts and declarative tests.

Usage
-----

Declare your stories as follows:

    require 'stories'

    class UserStoryTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
      story "As a user I want to create stories so I can test if they pass" do
        setup do
          @user = "valid user"
        end

        scenario "A valid user" do
          assert_equal "valid user", @user
        end
      end
    end

If you are using Rails, you can use stories for your integration tests with Webrat:

    class UserStoriesTest < ActionController::IntegrationTest
      story "As a user I want to log in so that I can access restricted features" do
        setup do
          @user = User.spawn :name => "Albert", :email => "albert@example.com"
        end

        scenario "Using good information" do
          visit "/"
          click_link "Log in"
          fill_in "Email", :with => user.email
          fill_in "Password", :with => user.password
          click_button "Sign in"

          assert_contain "Logout"
          assert_contain "Welcome Albert"
        end
      end
    end

This will produce the following output:

    - As a user I want to log in so that I can access restricted features
        Using good information
            Go to “/”
            Click “Log in”
            Fill in “Email” with “albert@example.com”
            Fill in “Password” with “secret”
            Click “Sign in”
            I should see “Logout”
            I should see “Welcome Albert”

Custom reports
--------------

Stories ships with reports for many Webrat helpers, but you can write your own version or add reports
for other helpers.

For instance, let's say you add this assertion:

    module Test::Unit::Assertions
      def assert_current_page(path)
        assert_equal path, current_url.sub(%r{^http://www\.example\.com}, '')
      end
    end

When you run it, no output will be generated because Stories doesn't know what to say about this assertion.
Adding a custom report is easy:

    module Stories::Webrat
      report_for :assert_current_page do |page|
        "I should be on #{quote(page)}"
      end
    end

All this should reside in your `stories_helper.rb`.

Step wrappers
---------------

There are two other methods that are useful for reporting steps or assertions: `silent` and `report`.

The `silent` helper gives you the ability to suspend the steps and assertions' normal output:

    ...
    silent do
      assert_contain "Some obscure hash"
    end
    ...

In a similar fashion, `report` lets you replace the normal output with your own message:

    ...
    report "I verify that the hash generated correctly" do
      assert_contain "The same obscure hash"
    end
    ...

Running stories
---------------

You can run it normally, it's Test::Unit after all. If you want to run a particular test, say "yet more tests", try this:

    $ ruby my_test.rb -n test_yet_more_tests

Or with a regular expression:

    $ ruby my_test.rb -n /yet_more_tests/

Pending stories
---------------

Since Stories aims to improve your project's documentation, you can have pending stories:

    class UserStoryTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
      story "As a user I want to create stories so I can test if they pass"
    end

This is useful if you want to write all your stories upfront, even before you write the acceptance tests.

Awesome output
--------------

You can get a nice output with your user stories with the `stories` runner:

    $ ruby my_test.rb --runner=stories

Now, if you want to impress everyone around you, try this:

    $ ruby my_test.rb --runner=stories-pdf

You will get a nicely formatted PDF with your user stories. It uses [Prawn](http://prawn.majesticseacreature.com/), so you will need to install it first.

If you're using Rails, you can run the whole build with the following Rake tasks:

    $ rake stories
    $ rake stories:pdf

Installation
------------

    $ sudo gem install stories

If you want to use it with Rails, add this to config/environment.rb:

    config.gem "stories"

Then you can vendor the gem:

    rake gems:install
    rake gems:unpack
